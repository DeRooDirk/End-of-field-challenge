* You are allowed, of course, to use documentation sites, Google, stackoverflow.com and any other resource that you would normally use. Internet is your friend.
* You MAY use SASS if it makes the job easier, but it will not give you extra points.
* You MAT NOT use a CSS framework, nor copy CSS code from a framework.
* Commit (and push) per feature or part (set a timer to remind you if you need to).
